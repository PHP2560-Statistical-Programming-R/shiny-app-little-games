<br/>

3. Note that you have to press "Reset" button before you start another game.

## DIFFICULTY
</div>
<br/>

1. If you choose to play with computer, you can choose either the easy version or hard version.

<br/>

2. The strategy of computer is basically prevent you from winning. In other words, the computer was designed to block you so you won't have stones in row. Note that the computer only block you on two sides of a row of stones.

<br/>

3. The difference between easy version and hard one is how to block you. In easy version, the computer will start to block you if you have at least one stone. But the position where it blocks you is random. As shown below, computer (white) will block you (black) in either of the five availabel spots, because you have two stones in row horizontally, vertically and diagonally.

<br/>

4. The hard version won't block unless you have at least two stones in row. It will choose depend on a series of checking. For example, in the picture below, there are two stone in row horizontally, vertically and diagonally. But the horizontal row has already been blocked by one white stone, so the computer will block either the vertical row or diagonal row.
