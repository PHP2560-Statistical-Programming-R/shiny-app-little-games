# R Snake app and R Flags app

## Inspiration

1. For R snake: the idea to make this game is from a R teaching website (http://blog.fens.me/r-game-snake/). It gives me the idea and teaches me step by step to make the iead work.

2. For R flags: I viewd a nice-looking Chinese flag which is drawn by using R. So I decide to transform some functions to draw some simply and easy country flags.
 

## What I Did

The original codes are quite old and used some packages that have already been deleted. So I fixed some bugs first and then added some new functions.

1. Deleted some old codes which used nonexistent packages and fixed some bugs such as the canvas setting, start order and game rules.

2. Added the button to change the difficulty of the game.

3. Created the start page and end page to make it look like a complete game.

4. Added rules to judge if someone wins (and return something after someone wins).

5. I collected some ready-made functions such as Japen flag function and Iceland flag function and also created some other countries' flags such as Finland flags and so on by modifying these ready-made functions. 

5. Added a button to choose countries and a button to change the density of the flag.


## About My Codes and Files

1. All codes and pictures are placed in the folder "App_Wei_Wang/R".

2. PNG and JPG files were used for plotting the game or instruction part.


## What I Can Improve

1. More flags can be added.

2. Make the Snake and the fruit look more beatiful in the game.

3. Let the Snake move by itself and players only need to control the direction.
