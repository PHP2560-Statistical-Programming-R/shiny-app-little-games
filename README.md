# Shiny App - LittleGames

## Description

1. This is an app consisting of four tiny games: Gomoku, R Snake, Mine Sweeper and R Flags.

2. This shiny app basically has the same content as the LittleGames R package. But changes were made in order to fit these games to a shiny app environment.

3. These four games were modified based on the original functions, which are attached in the individual files. There are also README files in individual folders that specify what changes we made to the original codes.

4. There are instructions for these games. You can read them once you open this app.

## Audience

Whoever interested in playing games are more than welcome to use this app. Moreover, if you are interested in creating games in R plotform, please use this app, because we really need your suggestions and ideas, which you can send to [this email](yimo_zhang@brown.edu).

## Break Down of Work

## Note

To make the codes neat, not a lot of comments were put in the combined version of app.R. But you can go through all the details in individual files, including all the functions and comments. We also make a package called [LittleGames](https://github.com/PHP2560-Statistical-Programming-R/r-package-the-best-team), you can scan that project to get more information.
