## Group Presentation Feedback

### What did your classmates like?

- impressive amount of functionality
- Great game boards!
- I like how you have the shiny app load an actual picture. It makes the Shiny app nicer.
- Made pictures by ggplot. Use shiny reactive plot
- It's a really fun idea, and it's nice to see how R can be used to make games. 
- This app is interesting and fun to play with
- The chess game.
- i liked the games and the fun graphics that you added
- Various kinds of interesting games in this app. Funny pictures appear when you win. And you can change the game rule and difficult levels, which make it more flexible.
- I liked how it showed the capabilities of R
- the ability to play live game like snake using R 
- The complexity & variety of the different parts of the app
- The variety of different things that this group showed the R platform could achieve.
- Programed games with R, the animation is very cool. 
- Visually appealing interface! I love the plot of the board and the message when a player wins , as well as the intro page for the snake game
- The games look like the real deal.They seem to work well.
- It's a pretty interesting app.
- All are interesting games, very creative.
- Very creative, good visuals, and lots of ideas in one app
- "- wow the flag was pretty cool, and I love snake, this like a great app to waste time 
the minesweeper looks just like the real thing "
- Very fun games created by R!
- Entertaining games with good graphics
- the app illustrated the power of R and shiny
- It was creative
- Games in R are not often to see and the interactions are in both button part and graphic part.





### What would you improve?

- I don't know the point of R flag, error message returned
- Explain what Gomoku is? Explain the difference between easy and hard level?
- Instructions for the game would be very useful.
- Add instructions of how to play game. 
- In R flag, it'd look nicer to take out the axes. If there was an option to input numbers rather than select, that'd make it easier to use too. 
- I think the games involved complicated algorithms which could be hard to write. If it is possible, the - group members could try to improve the game algorithms. 
- The games are exactly the same as what we played before and fully developed.
- you could add more games in the future
- One table for gomoku game in record tab didn't display. And the mine sweeper game user interface didn't appear in shiny but a new window. It may look better if it can be placed in Shiny app interface. - Where can the R flag part be used for? Is it a game? 
- All of the games need instructions on how to play and the point of the game
- as any other game, GRAPHICS,  adding game guides.   
- The individual games would be polished to feel smoother/cleaner design
- The difficulty of the minesweeper game could be improved by adjusting the first move function. Instead of opening up the whole map ti the nearest mine it should only open up to the nearest cells.
- fix the error in the app
- I think itâ€™d be useful to have instructions for all the games 
- I think you should remove the flag generator, not sure it fits with the app 
- 1. Country flag changes a little bit slow. 2. Could add game instruction. 3.Some code could not run.
- More games can be added.
- I didn't really understand the purpose of the R flag as a game that goes with the theme, but overall - - the R flag cam out really nice. Hopefully, they will fix the debugging issues they had when presenting. 
- instructions would be sweet, you could also set it so shiny won't show the error
- A general introduction of all games would be better
- Need to include play instructions and should lowercase their select buttons
- improve on layout and reduce number of popups
- It could use a description and how the group collaborated. 
- Maybe more element can be added. The graphic area seems a little empty right now.



### Tasks to Accomplish before turning it in:

- Create a tab that gives the rules for the games. Make sure this is nice in appearance and possibly include screen shots of the app. 
- Fix any kind of bugs for game play. 
- specify what changes were made and what code was added to your project.
